### Description: 
The original data consisted of the following:
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables
* training data
* test data
* bIts activity label
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment

The training and the test sets were combined to create one data set. Then only the measurements containing the mean and standard deviation for each measurement was extracted. The train and test labels were combine into one column called `label`. The subject_train and subjext_test files where also combind into one column called `subject` the test and train. The data set were combined using the `rbind()`. The label was then recoded using the `R recode()` function as follows:

* 1=WALKING 
* 2=WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3=WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4=SITTING 
* 5=STANDING
* 6=LAYING

The files were combined using the `R cbind()` function. 
The `aggregate()` function was used to aggregate the resultant data frame. `The aggregate()` function represents a summary of a scalar valued statistic, broken down by one or more groups. The `aggregate ()` presents the results in a data frame instead of a table.

### Number of Attributes:
* No. of attributes = 68
* No. of Instances = 180

Each row identified the mean of each measurement extracted and is grouped by activity label and the subject who performed the activity

### Attributes description:

activity:
* Identified the class labels with their activity name

subject:
* Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. the range is from 1 to 30
